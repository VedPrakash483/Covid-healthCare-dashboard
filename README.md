# COVID-19 Tracker: Hospital Resources, Cases, and Vaccination Status

![COVID-19 Tracker](https://example.com/covid-tracker-banner.jpg)

## üìä Project Overview

This comprehensive COVID-19 Tracker and Information System provides a user-friendly interface for monitoring and managing hospital resources, COVID-19 case data, and vaccination status. It features both a **frontend** (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and a **backend** (Node.js, Express, MongoDB), allowing users to view real-time hospital resources, update hospital information, and track vaccination progress across various regions.

## üåü Key Features

- üè• **Hospital Resources:** Real-time view of available beds, ICU beds, ventilators, and oxygen cylinders
- ü¶† **COVID-19 Cases:** Monitor and update case numbers by region
- üíâ **Vaccination Status:** Track vaccination progress across different areas
- üîê **Authentication:** Secure login system with token-based authentication
- üì± **Responsive Design:** Fully adaptive layout for all devices
- üîÄ **Flowchart:** Visual representation of the app workflow

## üõ† Project Setup

### Frontend Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/covid-19-tracker.git
   cd covid-19-tracker/frontend
2. **Install dependencies:**

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. Then, install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. **Run the Frontend:**

Start the frontend development server:

```bash
npm start
```

The app will be accessible at http://localhost:3000 by default.

4. **Update API Endpoints:**

In the frontend folder, go to index.js (or any other relevant JS file) and make sure the API URL is correct.

```javascript
const response = await fetch('http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/covid/hospitals/resources');
```

Replace http://127.0.0.1:5000 with your backend API URL if deployed remotely.

## Backend Setup

### Navigate to backend directory:
```bash
cd covid-19-tracker/backend
```

### Install Dependencies:

Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed. Then, install the necessary dependencies:

1. **Install Dependencies:**

```bash
npm install
```

2. **Set Up MongoDB:**

Make sure you have MongoDB installed and running locally, or use MongoDB Atlas for a cloud-based database.

3. **Local MongoDB:**

```bash
mongod
```

### Cloud MongoDB (MongoDB Atlas):

Create a MongoDB Atlas account.
Create a new cluster and get the connection string.
Update server.js with your connection string.

### Run the Backend:

Start the backend server:

```bash
node server.js
```

The backend will be accessible at http://localhost:5000 by default.

## Usage

### Login:

Upon visiting the app, users will be prompted to log in. The login functionality uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication.

### View Hospital Resources:

After logging in, users can view a table of hospital resources, including beds, ICU beds, ventilators, and oxygen cylinders.

### Update Resources:

Admins can update the hospital resources by filling out a form and submitting new values.

### View COVID-19 Cases:

Users can see the total number of COVID-19 cases for a particular region.

### Vaccination Status:

Users can view the vaccination progress by region and update vaccination statuses.

### Logout:

Click the "Logout" button in the navigation menu to end the session.
